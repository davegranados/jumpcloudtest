**Test Environment Setup**

Follow the instructions from The Document to set up the password hash app. Leave the terminal open, as this will help with testing (the app will report a few error error messages and can be used to verify when it is shutdown.

Test steps and results can be recorded on the Password Hash Testcases spreadsheet


**Automated Testing notes:**
If running all tests, note that the last test will shut down the test instance of the Password Hash app. If you want to avoid this, comment out the last tests.

The test script uses the json and requests modules. json should be part of a standard python install, but requests may need to be installed. This can be done via with pip:

pip install requests

These test script has been tested running through Pycharm and via cmd. Be sure Python is on your PATH.
